# mdbtocsv

### Description

mdbtocsv is a Windows console application written in c#.

#### mdbtocsv is NOT feature complete and is a work in progress.

### Prerequisites 
- 64 bit ODBC Access Driver installed.

### Usage

**mdbtocsv** -s:"sourceFileName" -noprompt -lower

The above example will extract all tables in source file as separate CSVs

**PARAMETERS**:

|OPTION|DESCRIPTION|
|----- | ----- |
|-s:sourceFileName | (required) The Access file to process. Wrap in quotes if you have spaces in the path.|
|-noprompt | disables the 'Continue' prompt. Program will run without the need for user interaction.|
|-o:directory | user specified output directory. Default = same path as source file.|
|-nolog | disables the runtime log. !!! Set as very first parameter to fully disable log.|
|-lower | force output filenames to be lowercase.|
|-p | use PIPE '\|' Delimiter in output file.|

This would parse all tables found in the receipts.mdb file, using the PIPE delimiter, cleaning the fieldnames, and writing the output filenames in lowercase.
